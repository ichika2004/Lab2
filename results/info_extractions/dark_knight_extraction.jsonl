It creates characters we come to care\nabout. That's because of the performances, of course. Heath Ledger's Joker is a\nscreen presence so powerful that he takes over the movie.\n\"The Dark Knight\" is not a simplistic tale of good and evil. Batman is good,\nyes, The Joker is evil, yes. But Batman poses a more complex puzzle than usual:\nThe citizens of Gotham City are in an uproar, calling him a vigilante and\nblaming him for the deaths of policemen and others. And the Joker is more than a\nvillain. He is a Mephistopheles whose actions are fiendishly designed to pose\nmoral dilemmas for his enemies.\nThe special effects are extraordinary. They focus on the expected explosions and\ncatastrophes, and have some superb, elaborate chase scenes. The movie was shot\non location in Chicago, but it avoids such familiar landmarks as Marina City,\nthe Wrigley Building or the skyline.\nIt is a film that understands the allure of darkness, sees how it can\nefficiently spread, and then presents us with the facts regarding the realities\nof honor, strength, and influence.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_6a161724"}
