      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "*   For its whole life, this star-balloon is full of fiery energy pushing outwards, which keeps it big and round.\n",

       "\n",
       "Think of space as a giant, stretchy trampoline.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   A normal planet, like Earth, is like a bowling ball. It sits on the trampoline and makes a little dip.\n",
       "*   Our Sun is heavier, so it's like a bigger bowling ball that makes a deeper dip. That's gravity! The planets are like little marbles rolling around in the dip the Sun makes.\n",

       "Now, a **black hole** is different. It's like taking that tiny, squished marble we made and realizing it's so heavy that it **rips a hole right through the trampoline.**\n",
       "\n",
       "It's not just a dip anymore; it's a bottomless pit. Anything that gets too close—other stars, planets, even light—doesn't just roll around it. It falls into the hole and can't get out.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Why They Are \"Black\": The Unbeatable Waterfall\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine light is the fastest speedboat in the entire universe. Nothing can go faster.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, picture a giant waterfall. The river leading to it is like the gravity of a black hole.\n",

       "\n",
       "That's what a black hole does to light. Its gravity is so powerful that once light crosses that \"point of no return,\" it gets pulled in forever. And if no light can escape from it, we can't see it. It just looks like a black spot in space.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "**So, to sum it up:**\n",
       "\n",
       "A **black hole** is what's left over when a giant star collapses into a tiny, super-heavy point. This point has so much gravity that it's like a **hole in the trampoline of space**, and its pull is so strong that it's like a **waterfall that even the fastest speedboat (light) can't escape.**\n",
       "\n",
       "They aren't space vacuum cleaners, though! They don't go around sucking everything up. You have to get very, very close to fall in. From far away, they're just another amazing, mysterious thing floating in our incredible universe."

      "\n",
      "\t\t Training and running LLMs, as well as many other complex machine learning models, requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data storage. Data centers provide the necessary infrastructure – high-performance servers, specialized hardware (like GPUs and TPUs), robust networking, and reliable power – to handle these computationally intensive tasks. Without data centers, it would be practically impossible to develop, train, and deploy LLMs at scale. \n",

Data centers are the physical environments and infrastructure that enable the training, deployment, and operation of both general machine learning models and highly demanding LLMs. LLMs rely on ML principles, and both ML and LLMs rely heavily on the resources provided by data centers. \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth.

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
